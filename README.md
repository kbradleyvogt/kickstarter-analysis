# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Purpose
Using the data 4,000 crowdfunded projects I was able to uncover and discover hiddened trends that will give the fundraiser an edge based on launch date and goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis I performed was to investigate how the fundraising outcomes were impacted by the launch date of the campaigns. I created a pivot table that grouped the data by the month of the launch date and into three categories; successful, failed and canceled. The attached line chart demonstrates the findings. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next analysis I performed was to review how the goal of the campaign correlated with the outcomes. This was specifically focused on the subcategory of plays. Here I found the total number of successful, failed, and canceled play projects and determined how they broke down as percentages. This line graph shows the relationship between the fundraising goals bins and the three different outcome percentages. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While reviewing the data, one challenge I encountered was to remember to add all the needed filters when build a new table or chart. Several times I thought I had completed a step, only to have to go back and add an additional filter. To overcome this type of challenge is to be attentive to detail and reread all instructions. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Reviewing the results of the theater outcomes by launch we can draw a few conclusions. May is the best month to launch a campaign and no month needs to be avoided for failure rates. 
The data for the failed theater projects has a tight distribution, which we can take to mean that there is not a month that has a higher probability of failure than the others. Look at that from the flip side, the month of May has the high total volume of successful projects and stands out, with the project success sloping down through the spring and summer. Autumn and winter months are relatively steady in their success rates.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Diving into the data regarding how the goal of the campaign may impact outcome there is an interesting distribution of success rates over 50%. On the lower end the goals were less than $5000, and on the higher end they were between $35,000 and $45,000. The highest chances for success, based on this data, would be for a campaign goal of less than $5,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data provided does not give us the full picture of what lead to the success or failure of each campaign. While we can find correlations, we do not have enough information to be confident in causations. We are missing important information about how the fundraisers were marketed. The data also doesnâ€™t give us any information about the donor population. Where they a friends and family network or did the campaign have a wider reach? 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Future possible analysis would be to create a histogram for the average donation size for successful campaigns to determine if there is an ideal amount to include as a suggested donation. Using the time lapse between the launched date and deadline, we could determine if there is an optimal number of days for a campaign to run. This could be graphed by creating a new column for time of campaign, braking the time into even bins and finding the percent of successful and failed for each to create a bar chart.
